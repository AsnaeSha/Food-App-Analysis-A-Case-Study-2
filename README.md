# Zomato-Data-Analysis
SQL PROJECT

In this self-curated case study, I analyzed Zomato's data using MySQL, focusing on Users, Sales, Product, and Gold Users Signup tables. The project aimed to uncover insights into user behavior, sales patterns, and the impact of the Gold Users Signup program. Leveraging data analysis tools and statistical methods, I derived actionable insights to optimize strategies and enhance customer experience. This project showcases my skills in handling real-world data and my dedication to data-driven decision-making in the food delivery industry.
